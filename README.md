# SB Agent Portal

SB Agent Portal is a powerful project designed to manage AI agents, enabling them to follow instructions, work with data using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and perform actions through function calling.

## Project Overview

The SB Agent Portal provides a comprehensive suite of tools and services for creating, managing, and interacting with AI agents. These agents are capable of:

1. Following instructions via prompts
2. Working with data using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
3. Performing actions through function calling

This system is built with a microservices architecture, utilizing TypeScript and modern JavaScript (ES6+) practices, with a preference for functional programming over object-oriented programming.
