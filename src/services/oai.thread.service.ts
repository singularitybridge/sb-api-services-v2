// This file previously contained functions for interacting with OpenAI threads.
// Since OpenAI Assistant API is deprecated in favor of Vercel AI,
// these functions are no longer needed and have been removed.
// Session management now handles thread IDs locally.

// If you need to implement similar Vercel AI thread/message functionality,
// this would be the appropriate place to add those services.
